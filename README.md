# Simple Python Calculator

This is a basic multifunction calculator built in Python. It allows users to perform the four fundamental arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

## Features
- Input validation for numeric values
- Error handling for division by zero
- Clean and simple command-line interface
- Beginner-friendly Python code

## How to Use
1. Run the Python script in your terminal or IDE.
2. Enter the first number.
3. Choose an operator (+, -, *, /).
4. Enter the second number.
5. View the result.

## Example Output
```
